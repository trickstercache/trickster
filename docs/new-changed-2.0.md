# Trickster 2.0

## What's Improved

2.0 continues to improve the Trickster project, with a ton of new features, bug fixes, and optimizations. Here's the quick rundown of what's new and improved:

- we now use YAML for configuration, and provide [tooling](http://github.com/trickstercache/tricktool) to migrate a 1.x TOML configuration
- example configurations are relocated to the [examples](../examples/conf) directory
- the [Trickster docker-compose demo](../examples/docker-compose) has been relocated to the examples directory and updated to use latest version tags
- we now use a common time series format internally for caching all supported TSDB's, rather than implementing each one separately
- [health checking](./health.md) now uses a common package for all backend providers, rather than implementing separately in each backend, and we now support automated health check polling for any backend, and provide a global health status endpoint
- we offer a brand new [Application Load Balancer](./alb.md) feature with unique and powerful options, like merging data from multiple backends into a single response.
- We've updated to Go 1.24
- We've re-organized many packages in the codebase to be more easily importable by other projects. Over the course of the beta, we'll be publishing new patterns to the [examples](../examples/) folder for using Trickster packages in your own projects, including caching, acceleration and load balancing.
- InfluxDB and ClickHouse now support additional output formats like CSV. More documentation will be provided over the course of the beta
- Expanded Compression support now includes options for Broti and Zstd
- The [Rules Engine](./rule.md) now supports `rmatch` operations to permit regular expression-based routing against any part of the HTTP request.
- You can now chain a collection of [request rewriters](./request_rewriters.md) for more robust possibilities.


## New in Beta 3
- We've switched to our all-new, made-for-proxies HTTP Request Router, which is up to 10X faster than the previous router
- We now support Purging specific cache items by Key or URL operations, via the Administrative (FKA Config Reload) Port - TODO: UPDATE DOCS
- We now support InfluxData's Flux query language for InfluxDB query acceleration
  - We resolved tons of issues around POST requests for InfluxQL too!
- THe Helm Charts repository is now updated for Trickster 2.0
- We now support [Cache Object Chunking](./chunked_caching.md)
  - Allows a Time Series to be chunked into multiple cache entries based on a configurable chunk size.
  - Only the chunk entries needed to span the request range are inspected, rather than the entire time series.
  - Significantly improves Redis and Filesystem performance of large timeseries records
  - Also supported by standard Reverse Proxy Cache for chunking objects by Byte Range
  - Disabled by default
- We now support [Time Series Backend Request Sharding](./timeseries_sharding.md)
  - Allows requests proxied to Time Series Backends to be chunked into multiple concurrent based on a configurable chunk size in arbitrary time units (milliseconds, seconds, etc) or by data points.
  - Backend Responses are merged into a single response before caching
  - Disabled by default
  - You can use Cache Chunking and TS Backend Request Sharding in any combination (on/on, on/off, off/on, off/0ff) as theywork together seamlessly. They can be configured with the same or different chunk sizes.
- We have added new CI tools, including better linters and race condition checkers
- We've updated our Docker automation:
  - The trickster-docker-images repo is now retired and image publishing is handled in the trickster repo.
  - All merges to main will now push an image to Docker Hub at `trickstercache/trickster:main` as well as to `trickstercache/trickster:<COMMIT_ID>`
    - We no longer push images to the legacy `tricksterio` and `tricksterproxy` orgs on DockeHub. Everything is now `trickstercache`!
  - Images are now pushed to the GitHub Container Repository:
    - `ghcr.io/trickstercache/trickster`
- We've eliminated over 70 race conditions and random panics
- We've switched from Regular Expression matches for SQL-based Time Series Backends to an extensible lexer/parser solution
  - ClickHouse backend providers now use the new SQL Parser
- We now support [Simulated Latency](./simulated-latency.md) if you want to use Trickster for that purpose in a test harness.
- We now support Environment variable substitution in configuration files where sensitive information is expected.
  - Supported via the following fields:
    - `caches[*].redis.password`, `backends[*].healthcheck.headers`, `backends[*].paths[*].request_headers`, `backends[*].paths[*].request_params`, `backends[*].paths[*].response_headers`
  - Usage: `password: ${MY_SECRET_VAR}`
- Previous Trickster 2.0 Betas used millisecond config values like `timeout_ms: 1500`. These have changed to `timeout: 1500ms`. See more details in the Configuration section below.
- We no longer include the `vendor` directory in the project repository and `vendor` is now in `.gitignore`. `vendor` will continue to be included in Release source tarballs.

## Still to Come

Trickster 2.0 is not yet feature complete, and we anticipate including the following additional features in Beta 4 before the GA Release:
- an up-to-date Grafana dashboard template for monitoring Trickster
- incorporate ALB examples into the docker-compose demo
- support for Auto-Discovery of Backend Targets (e.g., Kubernetes Pod Annotations)
- support MySQL as a Backend Time Series
- Support for InfluxDB 3.x

## Known Issues With the Latest Beta

The current Trickster 2.0 beta has the following known issues:

- the `lru` Time Series Eviction Method currently does not function, but will be added back in a future beta. This feature has not yet been ported into the Common Time Series format. Comment out this setting in your configuration to use the default eviction method.

## Installing

You can build the 2.0 binary from the `main` branch, download binaries from the [Releases](http://github.com/trickstercache/trickster/releases) page, or use the `trickstercache/trickster:2` Docker image tag in containerized environments.

## Breaking Changes from 1.x

### Metrics

- In metrics related to Trickster's operation, all label names of `origin_name` are changed to `backend_name`

### Configuration

Using [tricktool](http://github.com/trickstercache/tricktool) to migrate your configurations is the recommended approach. However, if you choose to convert your configuration by hand, here is what you need to know:

- <https://www.convertsimple.com/convert-toml-to-yaml/> is a good starting point
- The `[origins]` section of the Trickster 1.x TOML config is named `backends:` in the 2.0 YAML config
- All duration-based values are now represented in nanoseconds or as 'duration strings'.
  - A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimals, with one or more optional unit suffixes. Example: `1s500ms`
    - Supported time units: `"ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"`
  - 1.x values ending in `_secs` are the same in 2.0 but have no unit suffix (`timeout_secs` -> `timeout`). Be sure to add a unit -- `10 -> 10s`.
- `origin_type`, `cache_type` and `tracing_type` are now called `provider`.
- Health checking configurations now reside in their own `healthcheck` subsection under `backends` and use simplified config names like `method`, `path`, etc.

See the [example configuration](../examples/conf/example.full.yaml) for more information.
