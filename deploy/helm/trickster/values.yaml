#     # dearticulateUpstreamRanges: false

#     # multipartRangesDisabled, when true, instructs Trickster to return the full object when the client provides
#     # a multipart range request. The default is false.

#     # Each origin type implements their own defaults for hcUpstreamURL, hcVerb and hcQuery,
#     # which can be overridden per origin with the following configs. See https://github.com/Comcast/trickster/docs/health.md

#     # hcUpstreamURL is the URL Trickster will request against this origin to
