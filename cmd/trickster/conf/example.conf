# [main]

## instance_id allows you to run multiple Trickster processes on the same host and log to separate files
## Useful for baremetal, not so much for elastic deployments, so only uncomment if you really need it
## default is 0, which means ignored
#instance_id = 0

## config_handler_path provides the HTTP path to view a read-only printout of the running configuration
## which can be reached at http://your-trickster-endpoint:port/$config_handler_path
## default is '/trickster/config'

## ping_handler_path provides the HTTP path you will use to perform an uptime health check against Trickster
## which can be reached at http://your-trickster-endpoint:port/$ping_handler_path
## default is '/trickster/ping'
# ping_handler_path = '/trickster/ping'

## health_handler_path provides the HTTP path prefix you will use to perform an uptime health check against
## configured Trickster origins via http://trickster/$health_handler_path/$origin_name
## default is '/trickster/health'. Set to empty string to fully disable upstream health checking
# health_handler_path = '/trickster/health'

## pprof_server provides the name of the http listener that will host the pprof debugging routes
## Options are: "metrics", "reload", "both", or "off"; default is both
# pprof_server = 'both'

## Negative Caching Configurations
## A Negative Cache is a map of HTTP Status Codes that are cached for the specified duration,
## used for temporarily caching failures (e.g., 404's for 10 seconds)
##
## By default, each Origin Configuration maps to the 'default' negative cache which you can
## configure below, or can define your own negative caches, and specify them in your origin configs.
## See /docs/negative-caching.md for more info.
##

# [negative_caches]
#   [negative_caches.default]
#   # The 'default' negative cache config, mapped by all origins by default,
#   # is empty unless you populate it. Update it by adding entries here in the format of:
#   # code = ttl_secs

##  Here's a pre-populated negative cache config ready to be uncommented and used in an origin config
##  The 'general' negative cache config will cache common failure response codes for 3 seconds
#   [negative_caches.general]
#   400 = 3
#   404 = 3
#   500 = 3
#   502 = 3

# Configuration options for mapping Origin(s)
[origins]

    # example origin named default. default is always created with these settings unless a different origin is defined here.
    # access this origin via http[s]://trickster-fqdn/default/ unless path_routing_disabled is true
    [origins.default]

    # origin_type identifies the origin type.
    # Valid options are: 'prometheus', 'influxdb', 'clickhouse', 'irondb', 'reverseproxycache' (or just 'rpc')
    # origin_type is a required configuration value
    origin_type = 'prometheus'

    # origin_url provides the base upstream URL for all proxied requests to this origin.
    # it can be as simple as http://example.com or as complex as https://example.com:8443/path/prefix
    # origin_url is a required configuration value
    origin_url = 'http://prometheus:9090'

    ## is_default describes whether this origin is the default origin considered when routing http requests
    ## it is false, by default; but if you only have a single origin configured, is_default will be true unless explicitly set to false
    # is_default = true

    ## hosts indicates which FQDNs requested by the client should route to this Origin (in addition to path-based routing)
    ## if you are using TLS, all FQDNs should be included in the certfiicate common names to avoid insecure warnings to clients
    ## default setting is empty list. List format is: hosts = [ '1.example.com', '2.example.com' ]
    # hosts = []

    ## cache_name identifies the name of the cache (configured above) that you want to use with this origin proxy. default is 'default'
    # cache_name = 'default'

    ## forwarded_headers indicates whether Trickster should use 'Forwarded', 'X-Forwarded-*'
    ## or no forwarded headers when communicating with origins. A Via header is always sent,
    ## regardless of this value's setting.
    ## Options are 'standard', 'x', 'both', or 'none'; default is 'standard'
    # forwarded_headers = 'standard'

    ## cache_key_prefix defines the prefix this origin appends to cache keys. When using a shared cache like Redis,
    ## this can help partition multiple trickster instances that may have the same same hostname or ip address (the default prefix)
    # cache_key_prefix = 'example'

    ## negative_cache_name identifies the name of the negative cache (configured above) to be used with this origin. default is 'default'
    # negative_cache_name = 'default'

    ## path_routing_disabled will prevent the origin from being accessible via /origin_name/ path to Trickster. Disabling this requires
    ## the origin to have hosts configured (see below) or be the target of a rule origin, or it will be unreachable.
    ## default is false
    # path_routing_disabled = false

    ## rule_name provides the name of the rule config to be used by this origin.
    ## This is only effective if the origin_type is 'rule'
    # rule_name = 'example-rule'

    ## req_rewriter_name is the name of a configured rewriter (in [request_rewriters]) that will modify the request prior to
    ## processing by the origin client
    # req_rewriter_name = 'example-rewriter'

    ## tracing_name selects the distributed tracing configuration (crafted below) to be used with this origin. default is 'default'
    # tracing_name = 'default'

    ## dearticulate_upstream_ranges, when true, instructs Trickster to make multiple parallel requests to the origin for each
    ## range needed to fulfill the client request, rather than making a multipart range request. default is false
    ## This setting applies only to object request byte ranges and not time series requests (they are always dearticulated)
    # dearticulate_upstream_ranges = false

    ## multipart_ranges_disabled, when true, instructs Trickster to return the full object when the client provides
    ## a multipart range request. This setting applies only to object request byte ranges and not time series requests.
    ## The default is false.
    # multipart_ranges_disabled = false

    ## compressable_types defines the Content Types that will be compressed when stored in the Trickster cache
    ## reasonable defaults are set, so use this with care. To disable compression, set compressable_types = []
    ## Default list is provided here:
    # compressable_types = [ 'text/javascript', 'text/css', 'text/plain', 'text/xml', 'text/json', 'application/json', 'application/javascript', 'application/xml' ]

    ## timeout_secs defines how many seconds Trickster will wait before aborting and upstream http request. Default: 180s
    # timeout_secs = 180

    ## keep_alive_timeout_secs defines how long Trickster will wait before closing a keep-alive connection due to inactivity
    ## if the origin's keep-alive timeout is shorter than Trickster's, the connect will be closed sooner. Default: 300
    # keep_alive_timeout_secs = 300

    ## max_idle_conns set the maximum concurrent keep-alive connections Trickster may have opened to this origin
    ## additional requests will be queued. Default: 20
    # max_idle_conns = 20

    ## max_ttl_secs defines the maximum allowed TTL for any object cached for this origin. default is 86400
    # max_ttl_secs = 86400

    ## revalidation_factor is the multiplier for object lifetime expiration to determine cache object TTL; default is 2
    ## for example, if a revalidatable object has Cache-Control: max-age=300, we will cache for 10 minutes (300s * 2)
    ## so there is an opportunity to revalidate
    # revalidation_factor = 2

    ## max_object_size_bytes defines the largest byte size an object may be before it is uncacheable due to size. default is 524288 (512k)
    # max_object_size_bytes = 524288

    ## These next 6 settings only apply to Time Series origins

    ## backfill_tolerance_secs prevents new datapoints that fall within the tolerance window (relative to time.Now) from being cached
    ## Think of it as "never cache the newest N seconds of real-time data, because it may be preliminary and subject to updates"
    ## default is 0
    # backfill_tolerance_secs = 0

    ## timeseries_retention_factor defines the maximum number of recent timestamps to cache for a given query. Default is 1024
    # timeseries_retention_factor = 1024

    ## timeseries_ttl_secs defines the relative expiration of cached timeseries. default is 6 hours (21600 seconds)
    # timeseries_ttl_secs = 21600

    ## timeseries_eviction_method selects the metholodogy used to determine which timestamps are removed once
    ## the timeseries_retention_factor limit is reached. options are 'oldest' and 'lru'. Default is 'oldest'
    # timeseries_eviction_method = 'oldest'

    ## fast_forward_disable, when set to true, will turn off the 'fast forward' feature for any requests proxied to this origin
    # fast_forward_disable = false

    ## fastforward_ttl_secs defines the relative expiration of cached fast forward data. default is 15s
    # fastforward_ttl_secs = 15

    ##
    ## Each origin type implements their own defaults for health_check_upstream_url, health_check_verb and health_check_query,
    ## which can be overridden per origin. See /docs/health.md for more information
    
    ## health_check_upstream_url is the URL Trickster will request against this origin to
    ## when a health check request is received by Trickster via http://<trickster-endpoint>/trickster/<origin_name>/health 
    ## this is the default value for prometheus:
    # health_check_upstream_url = '/api/v1/query'

    ## health_check_verb is the HTTP Method Trickster will when performing an upstream health check for this origin
    ## default is 'GET' for all origin types unless overridden per-origin here.
    # health_check_verb = 'GET'

    ## health_check_query is the query string Trickster will append the when performing an upstream health check for this origin
    ## This value is the default for prometheus (again, see /docs/health.md)
    # health_check_query = 'query=up'

        ## health_check_headers provides a list of HTTP Headers to add to Health Check HTTP Requests to this origin
        # [origins.default.health_check_headers]
        # Authorization = 'Basic SomeHash'

        ## [origins.ORIGIN_NAME.paths] section customizes the behavior of Trickster for specific paths. See /docs/paths.md for more info.
        # [origins.default.paths]
            # [origins.default.paths.example1]
            # path = '/api/v1/admin/'
            # methods = [ '*' ]                                 # HTTP methods to be routed with this path config. '*' for all methods.
            # match_type = 'prefix'                             # match $path* (using 'exact' will match just $path)
            # handler = 'localresponse'                         # don't actually proxy this request, respond immediately
            # response_code = 401
            # response_body = 'No soup for you!'
            # no_metrics = true                                 # do not record metrics for requests to this path
                # [origins.default.paths.example1.response_headers]

        ## the [origins.ORIGIN_NAME.tls] section configures the frontend and backend TLS operation for the origin
        # [origins.default.tls]

        ## TLS Frontend Configs
        ## You can configure which certificate and key to use when this endpoint serves downstream clients over TLS
        ## Trickster will fail out at startup if the provided files do not exist, are unreadable, or in an invalid format
        ## These settings by default are '' (empty string), which disables this origin from being routed over the TLS port
        # full_chain_cert_path = '/path/to/your/cert.pem'
        # private_key_path = '/path/to/your/key.pem'

        ## TLS Backend Configs
        ## These settings configure how Trickster will behave as a client when communicating with
        ## this origin over TLS
        
        ## if insecure_skip_verify is true, Trickster will trust the origins certificate without any verification
        ## default is false
        # insecure_skip_verify = false
        
        ## certificate_authority_paths provides a list of additional certificate authorities to be used to trust an upstream origin
        ## in addition to Operating System CA's.  default is an empty list, which insructs the Trickster to use only the OS List
        # certificate_authority_paths = [ '../../testdata/test.rootca.pem' ]
        
        ## client_cert_path provides the path to a client certificate for Trickster to use when authenticating with an upstream server
        ## empty string '' by default
        # client_cert_path = '/path/to/my/client/cert.pem'
        
        ## client_key_path provides the path to a client key for Trickster to use when authenticating with an upstream server
        ## empty string '' by default
        # client_key_path = '/path/to/my/client/key.pem'

    ## For multi-origin support, origins are named, and the name is the second word of the configuration section name.
    ## In this example, an origin is named "foo".
    ## Clients can indicate this origin in their path (http://trickster.example.com:8480/foo/api/v1/query_range?.....)
    ## there are other ways for clients to indicate which origin to use in a multi-origin setup. See the documentation for more information

## Configuration Options for Request Rewriter Instructions - see /docs/request_rewriters.md for more info
#
# [request_rewriters]

## Configuration Options for Tracing Instrumentation. see /docs/tracing.md for more information
# [tracing]

    ## This is the default tracing config with it's default options, which you can change here.
    ## you can also add additional tracing configs here. user-defined tracing configs are mapped
    ## to origins by the 'tracing_name' value in origin configs, which, by default, use 'default'
    # [tracing.default]

    ## tracer_type specifies the type of backend tracing system where traces are sent (in that format)
    ## options are: jaeger, zipkin, stdout or none.  none is the default
    # tracer_type = 'none'

    ## service_name specifies the service name under which the traces are registered by this tracer
    ## default is 'trickster'
    # service_name = 'trickster'

    ## collector_url is the URL of the tracing backend
    ## required for zipkin and jaeger, unused for stdout
    # collector_url = 'http://jaeger:14268/api/traces'

    ## collector_user is the username credential for authenticating with the tracing backend
    ## optional jaeger; unused for zipkin and stdout
    # collector_user = ''

    ## collector_pass is the username credential for authenticating with the tracing backend
    ## optional jaeger; unused for zipkin and stdout
    # collector_pass = ''

    ## sample_rate sets the probability that a span will be recorded.
    ## A floating point value of 0.0 to 1.0 (inclusive) is permitted
    ## default is 1.0 (meaning 100% of requests are recorded)
    # sample_rate = 1.0

    ## omit_tags is a list of tag names that, while normally added by Trickster to various spans,
    ## are omitted for spans produced by this tracer. The default setting is empty list.
    # omit_tags = []
    
      ## tags will append these tags/attributes to each trace that is recorded
      ## only string key/value tags are supported. numeric values, etc are not.
      ## For Jaeger, these key/values are added to the "Process" section
      ## default tags list is empty
      # [tracing.default.tags]
      # key1 = "value1"
      # key2 = "value2"

      ## configurations for this tracer, specific to jaeger
      # [tracing.default.jaeger]
      ## endpoint_type indicates whether the jaeger tracing backend is a 'collector' or 'agent'
      ## default is 'collector'
      # endpoint_type = 'collector'

      ## configurations for this tracer, specific to stdout
      # [tracing.default.stdout]
      ## pretty_print indicates whether the output to stdout is formatted better human readability
      ## default is false
      # pretty_print = false

    ## another example tracing config named 'example' using jaeger agent backend and a 50% sample rate
    # [tracing.example]
    # tracer_type = 'jaeger'
    # collector_url = 'jaeger:6831'
    # sample_rate = .5
    #   [tracing.example.jaeger]
    #   endpoint_type = 'agent'

    ## another example tracing config named 'zipkin-example' using zipkin backend and a 10% sample rate
    # [tracing.zipkin-example]
    # tracer_type = 'zipkin'
    # collector_url = 'https://zipkin.example.com:9411/api/v2/spans'
    # sample_rate = .1


## Configuration Options for Metrics Instrumentation
# [metrics]
## listen_port defines the port that Trickster's metrics server listens on at /metrics
## 8481 is the default
# listen_port = 8481
## listen_address defines the ip that Trickster's metrics server listens on at /metrics
## empty by default, listening on all interfaces
# listen_address = ''

## Configuration Options for Config Reloading
# [reloading]
## listen_port defines the port where Trickster's config reload server listens
## 8484 is the default 
# listen_port = 8484
## listen_address defines the ip where Trickster's config reload server listens
## empty by default, listening on all interfaces
# listen_address = ''
## handler_path defines the HTTP path where the Reload interface is available.
## by default, this is '/trickster/config/reload'
# handler_path = '/trickster/config/reload'
## drain_timeout_secs defines how long old HTTP listeners will live to allow
## outstanding connection to close organically, before the listener is forcefully closed
## the default is 30
# drain_timeout_secs = 30
## rate_limit_secs specifies the rate limit timeout duration to apply to the HTTP reload interface.
## The reload interface is disabled for this duration of time whenever a config reload request is
## made that fails because the underlying config file is unmodified. default is 3
# rate_limit_secs = 3

## Configuration Options for Logging Instrumentation
# [logging]
## log_level defines the verbosity of the logger. Possible values are 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error'
## default is 'info'
# log_level = 'info'

## log_file defines the file location to store logs. These will be auto-rolled and maintained for you.
## not specifying a log_file (this is the default behavior) will print logs to STDOUT
# log_file = '/some/path/to/trickster.log'
